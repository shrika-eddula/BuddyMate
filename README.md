# BuddyMate

This project was done over the summer of 2023 for the United States Army. The task was to research and design a smartphone sized drone attachment that can remotely assess a wounded Warfighter's state of consciousness on the battlefield asper the Glasgow Coma Scale. Through a combination of computer vision and natural language processing, the approach integrates both AI and functional hardwarecomponents, such as optical, audio, and laser, in a semi-autonomous system as a tool for future Army Medics that can give vital insight into a wounded Warfighter's neurological state.
